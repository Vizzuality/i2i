// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts,
// vendor/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
